# Markup

This module adds the ability for site admins to add "Markup" widgets to the 
form. These essentially let designers of content-types insert additional 
markup into the node/edit form to display to content-authors. This is the 
equivalent of adding additional elements to $form of the type '#markup'.

Please, offer feedback and ideas in the issue queue.

Pull Requests are welcome.

## Status

We ran this module through coder upgrade and it worked pretty much as it was. 
We will initially mark this module as an alpha release and welcome testing
and feedback. But, it's a pretty simple module, so we expect it will work 
fine.
